Cleaning Data Ideas:
-Are the coordinates properly formatted?
-Can we complete data that is missing with complementary files?
-Boundary Check. We are not sure on whether to eliminate the data outside boundaries.
Is it a low percentage of bridges are outside boundaries?
Check whether this bridges are important?

Conclusion: 
Lets make a first scan to see if roads and bridges match and then work with what is left.
